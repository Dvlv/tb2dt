# Toolbox-2-desktop

When you install software in a Toolbox on Fedora Silverblue, you don't get a desktop entry for it.

This script will copy the desktop entry from the toolbox to your host system.

## Usage

Just execute the script:

```bash
./tb2dt
```

Then enter the name of the toolbox and the program when prompted.
